# Toolbox Work
This option is located under Work and is so frequently used. Here's what's in it:
 
1.	Options to change the atom type. If you have a selection and press one of these buttons, the selected atoms will be changed according to which button was pressed. If there is no selection and you press one of these buttons, all subsequently clicked atoms will be changed to the selected atom type.
2.	Automatic hydrogen placement and options for isotropic or ani-sotropic modelling of displacement parameters. If the box to the left of this is ticked, the structure will be automatically refined after the addition of hydrogen atoms.
3.	Options from left to right, to change all Q-peaks to C, all Q-peaks to H, tidy the structure, delete all hydrogen atoms, toggle Q-peaks through various options, toggle hydrogen atoms through various options and combine all fragments as close together as possible. On the right hand side is the option to change Z' and update the chemical composition using  . 
4.	Display sections of the structure by part number (useful for disorder).
5.	Set what information about the atoms should be displayed in the atom labels.
6.	Selects the Q-peaks that are displayed, slide to the right to hide strongest peaks first or to the left to hide weakest peaks first.
7.	Select atoms by the size of the displacement parameter. Slide to the right to select the ‘biggest’ atoms, and to the left to select the ‘smallest’ atoms.
8.	A selection of available options for treating disorder, displaying elec-tron density maps or growing the structure. 0.
