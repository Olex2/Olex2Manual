#	Atom Label Display Options
Olex2 offers a large range of properties that can be displayed as labels on atoms. This provides immediate feedback on these properties of the atoms: `Work | Toolbox Work | Labels`:
- _Toggle On/Off_ – show or hide atom name labels and Q-peak labels (alternatively press F3). This will switch other types of labelling off but selecting it again will display atom name labels.
- _Atom Names_ – F3 shows non-hydrogen atom and Q-peak labels
- _Crystallographic Occupancy_ – displays the occupancy of any atoms which are not 100% occupied i.e. their occupancy is not 1.
- _Chemical Occupancy_ – displays the occupancy of any atoms which are not 100% occupied i.e. their occupancy is not 1.
- _Parts_ – displays part numbers for any atoms not in part 0.
- _Link-Code_ – this is displayed SHELX `FVAR' style: 21 and -21 etc.
- _H Atom Labels_ – will include the hydrogen atom labels along with the atom name and Q-peak labels.
- _Fixed Parameters_ – if any parameters are fixed, these will be displayed as the atom label: occupancy, xyz, Ueq.
- _Variables_ – displays all variables associated with the atom.
- _AFIX Commands_ – useful to check the AFIX commands that are being applied to the structure.
- _Q-Peak Intensities_ – intensities of the Q-peaks will be displayed.
