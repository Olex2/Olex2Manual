\chapter{Structure Determination of Sucrose}

This section provides a guide to the basic structure solution and refinement of sucrose. With these step-by-step instructions, you will be able to repeat this structure solution and refinement process for yourself, and this will help you become familiar with the way in which Olex2 works. One of the sample structures supplied with Olex2 is sucrose, so you have everything you need to get started included in the software.
