# More Commands and Options
As mentioned at the start of the manual, all of the functionality available within the GUI panel can also be achieved using the command-line, the reverse is not true. There is a large amount of extra functionality with Olex2 that is currently only available through the command-line and cannot be accessed through the GUI panel. It is also worth noting that Olex2 recognises and can apply all ShelXL and all relevant XP commands, restraints and constraints whilst providing additional functionality. Hence, some of the commands are unique to Olex2 and cannot be interpreted by ShelXL.
