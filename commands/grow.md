>A [atoms] [-w] [-s]

>B Grows all possible/given atoms; for polymeric structures or structures that require to be grown several times Olex2 will continue grow until the operation results in a symmetry element that has been used previously.

>C -w: permits the application of symmetry previously used operations to other fragments of the asymmetric 

>D If the main molecule is grown, but only one solvent molecule is shown, using `CODE grow -w will produce other solvent molecules using symmetry operators used to grow the main molecule.
