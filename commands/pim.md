#pim

>B Helps with creating pictures when metal - pi interactions needs special drawing (like in the case of Cp-Me a single bond will be rendered from the ring centroid to the metal vs 5 bonds from every C atom to the metal). Note that currently these stippled bonds do not appear in the PostScript rendered pictures and thus for PS pictures a workaround with creating centroids is needed. To remove all of the lines created by this command - right click on one of them and choose Graphics->Select the group, then hit Del key.
