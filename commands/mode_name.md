**-a**: autocomplete, turned off by default. Value 1 switches the autocompleting on, with value 2 stopping the procedure when an atom of a different type is encountered on the way. Value 4 - when an atom with a different part is encountered on the way and value 6 is selected when combining the cases of 2 and 4. A special value, 8, does automatic naming.
