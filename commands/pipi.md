>A [centroid-to-centroid distance 4 \\A] [centroid-to-centroid shift 3 ANGST] [-g] [-r=C6,NC5]


>B The command analyses the p-p interactions (only stacking interactions for now) for flat regular C6 or NC5 rings and prints information for the ones where the intercentroid distance is smaller than [4] \\A and the intercentroid shift is smaller than [3] \\A. 

>C -g: if any of the rings is fully or partially constructed of symmetry generated atoms, it grows the structure using those symmetry operators. 
-r: ring content, the defaults are C6 and NC5 rings, the rings are tested for being flat and regular.
