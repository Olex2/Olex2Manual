>A {sfil, pers, isot, isoth, bond, vdw}

>B A function for drawing styles development; applies different radii to all/selected atoms.

>C sfil: sphere packing radii (as in ShelXTL XP)
pers: a fixed radii for model viewing
isot: each atom has it's own radius depending on the value of the Uiso or ADP
isoth: same as isot, but the H atoms are also displayed with their real Uiso's
bond: all atoms get same radii as default bond radius
vdw: the default/loaded Van der Waals radii used in most of the calculations
