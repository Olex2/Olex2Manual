>A sel atoms where xatom.bai.mw > 20	Select all atoms where the atomic mass is larger than 20

>A sel atoms where xatom.bai.z > 2

>B Select all atoms where the atomic number greater than 2

>A sel 1555

>B Will select all currently shown symmetry generated atoms which were generated by the given symmetry operation

>A sel rings NC5

>B Will select all NC5 rings in the structure

>A sel fvar -2

>B Selects atoms  where a parameters is linked to FVAR 2 as (1- value of the FVAR)

>A sel part 1

>B Will select part 1 of the structure

>A sel isot

>B Selects all isotropic atoms

>A sel  frag C5

>B selects the whole fragment containing C5

>A sel $E

>B Selects all atoms of the given type. E is a chemical element symbol or one of the following: * - all types M - all metals X - all halogens

>A sel $*,E

>B Selects all atoms, but of the E type, for example:

>A Sel $*,H 
Selects all non-H atoms

>A sel wbox

>B Shows the 3D selection box constructed for all/selected atoms; this box can be used to pack the structure or to crop the voids display/electron density maps. If the third argument (cell) is provided, the frame gets the size/dimensions of the unit cell rather than being rectangular. (This box can be used for packing and 3D maps trimming/extending).

>A sel ofile N	Selects overlayed file N; if N is 0 -- elements of the currently focused file are selected
