>A sel atoms where xatom.bai.mw > 20	

>B Select all atoms where the atomic mass is larger than 20

>A sel atoms where xatom.bai.z > 2

>B Select all atoms where the atomic number is greater than 2

>A sel 1555

>B Will select all symmetry generated atoms currently shown, which were generated by the given symmetry operation.

>A sel rings NC5

>B Will select all NC5 rings in the structure

>A sel fvar -2

>B Selects atoms where a parameter is linked to FVAR 2 as '1- value of the FVAR'

>A sel part 1

>B Will select part 1 of the structure

>A sel isot

>B Selects all isotropic atoms

>A sel frag C5

>B selects the whole fragment containing C5

>A sel $E

>B Selects all atoms of the given type. E is a chemical element symbol or one of the following: * - all types, M - all metals, X - all halogens

>A sel $*,E

>B Selects all atoms, but of the E type.

>A Sel $*,H 

>B Selects all non-H atoms

>A sel wbox

>B Shows the 3D selection box constructed for all/selected atoms. This box can be used to pack the structure or to crop the voids display/electron density maps. If the third argument (cell) is provided, the frame gets the dimensions of the unit cell rather than being rectangular (this box can be used for packing and 3D maps trimming/extending).

>A sel ofile N	

>B Selects overlayed file N; if N is 0, elements of the currently focused file are selected
