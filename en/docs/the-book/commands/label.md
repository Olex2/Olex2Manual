#label

>A [atoms]

>B Adds labels to all/given/selected atoms and bonds. These labels can be moved by pressing the SHIFT key while holding down the LEFT MOUSE button, and edited by double-clicking on them.

>C
 * **-type**: {subscript, brackets, default
 * **-symm**: {[$], #, full} - if an atom is generated by non-identity symmetry operation, it will be added as a superscript. Note that if # is used as the symmetry identifier then the labels of every type of new atom generated (in growing or packing) should be recalculated. Olex2 will then print current mapping of the symmetry numbers to the symmetry operators.
