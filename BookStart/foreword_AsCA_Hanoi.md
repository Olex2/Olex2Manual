#Getting Started with Olex2

This version of the full official Olex2 manual has been produced especially for the AsCA Meeting in Hanoi 2016.

#Olex2 Crystallographic Software

Olex2 is an immensely powerful program that handles very complex crystallographic tasks through an intuitive GUI. The graphical user interface is the result of 12 years of striving to provide the best possible experience to modelling even the most challenging structures with ease. The software originated at Durham University and had been in active development since 2004. Currently in development are extensions to improve productivity, some of which are already available to try out.

#OlexSys Ltd
Founded in 2010 and still based at Durham University, OlexSys Ltd has one aim: To develop and improve Olex2 far into the future, while ensuring the core software remains open source and free. We understand what is involved in determining proper crystal structures and we benefit enormously from being firmly embedded in the academic environment; understanding all steps of the crystallography process, from crystallisation, crystal selection, data collection and reduction through to structure solution, refinement and presentation.

\noindent
OlexSys Ltd offers extensive crystallographic services:

- Crystal growth and data collection
- Preparation of crystallographic texts
- Generation of publication-quality crystallographic reports
- Pre-publication structure and manuscript checking
- Replies to Referee's comments
- Database curation of crystallographic data
- Crystallographic cloud services
- Olex2 Workshops
