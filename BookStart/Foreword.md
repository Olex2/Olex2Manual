#Foreword
Olex2 has been in active development since 2004 -- yes, it's been 12 years! And yet we have only recently made an attempt at publishing a manual for this increasingly popular software in the field of small-molecule crystallography.

The main reason why this hasn't happened before is quite simply the fact that too much has been changing too quickly within Olex2. Right now, we have reached a good stable version of Olex2 where we envisage relatively few updates in the User Interface. The development of the underlying core will continue at a fast pace, but this won't affect the validity of a manual as much as changes in the User Interface do.

This version of the manual is intended for use with Olex2 version 1.2.9, which was released in August 2016 and extensively updated in July 2017. It will also largely be valid for any other version in the 1.2 series of Olex2, but won't do for older versions and will also become obsolete with the next version of Olex2: Olex2 2.0 which we will release in due course.
