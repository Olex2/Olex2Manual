Installation of Olex2 
--------
Olex2 is available free of charge for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux and the installers and zip archives can be obtained from www.Olex2.org. The Windows installer is a small application that will check your system and then download the relevant Olex2 installation file. In most cases, installation will be very straightforward, but there are various manual options available -- including compiling your own version from source code repositories. For Mac OS X there is a DMG image for the release version and zip files for alpha and beta releases. Currently we only provide 32-bit builds for Mac. For Linux there are zip file for 32 and 64 bit versions of the operating system.
Olex2 must be installed and launched at least once in an administrator mode in order for all of the features to work properly.

Variants of Olex2
--------
The current release version of Olex2 is version 1.2.3. Of this version, we distribute three variants: the alpha, beta and release version. The alpha version will be updated rather more often than the others and you can expect to see more bugs. The beta version will be updated once we are close to making an official release and the release version will only be updated after we've had feedback from our beta testers. You can install and run all three versions independently on one computer. So if you want to help us by testing the alpha and beta versions, please give them a go and feedback any problems to us. If something goes wrong, you can always fall back on the release version to complete your work.

Updating Olex2
--------
Unless you change the settings in the menu bar on the top (Help > Update Options), Olex2 will automatically check for updates on start-up if you are connected to the internet. If updates are found, these will be downloaded in the background and applied on the next start-up of the software. Updates only happen within the same series and variant (see above) -- eventually the current 1.2.3 version of Olex2 will update to the 1.2.4 version, but it will not automatically update to Olex2 2.0 -- instead a notice regarding the new release will appear in the graphical user interface panel (GUI panel).
