\noindent This booklet is our very first draft of an Olex2 manual and has been produced in very limited numbers for the Olex2 workshops.
There is a lot of room for improvement, and we are asking you to help us with this. We ask you to annotate this book: go wild and scribble all over it: and send it back to us when you are done.
We will send your copy back to you, and you will also receive the next version of this manual as soon as it has been published.
