#Introduction
Olex2 is a powerful tool for small molecule crystallography and is designed to be simple to use for novice users while providing complex functionality and tools for experts. Olex2 provides features for a complete structure determination from structure solution and refinement, through report writing and CIF generation to producing images.

This manual is by no means exhaustive but aims to provide a solid overview of Olex2 and its capabilities, so that you can start tackling crystal structure solution, refinement, CIF (Crystal Information File) generation and produce images. There is often more than one way to complete a task in Olex2, but this manual focuses predominantly on the use of the GUI panel to explain the most commonly required functionality.

There are many commands in Olex2 which are accessible through the command-line. Some of these commands are very useful for crystallographic work, and these are highlighted in this text using this `CODE refine` formatting. Items you can expect to find on the GUI panel, e.g. `@Work|Toolbox-Work` are highlighted in this format. Buttons or links that do something look like this: @@Refine@@.

Paragraphs that are Olex2-specific are highlighted in this way throughout this manual:

>CRYST Olex2 supports all ShelX commands as well as having its inbuilt structure solution and refinement packages and advanced tools to assist in your work.

Information that is more generally applicable to the process of small-molecule solution and refinement is shown like this:

>OLEX2 The manual also includes a step-by-step guide to the use of Olex2 to determine the crystal structure of sucrose.

This guide is a work in progress, and the source code of it is available on GitHub. If you are interested in helping us in improving this manual, or in providing a translation for it, please get in touch with us!

We would also like to draw your attention to our YouTube site at \url{http://bit.ly/2g1tZWj}. New videos are added regularly -- often as a response to some user requests. If you have a problem with your structure, and think that a video might help, please let us know! We will treat all structures (and videos!) confidentially, until your work is published and you give us permission to make the video public.
