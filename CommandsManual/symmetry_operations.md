NOCOLUMNS

If some atoms are deleted after growing operations, Olex2 will use existing unique atoms as the asymmetric unit atoms; this can be helpful to avoid a sequence of sgen/kill commands.
`CODE labels -l -i`: Adds labels only to the `original' - i.e. not created by symmetry - molecule.
In a packed structure: Right-click on a bond > Graphics > Select the Groups(s): Will select all bonds (or atoms) of that type in the grown structure.
