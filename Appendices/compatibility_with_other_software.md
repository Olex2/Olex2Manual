# Compatibility with Other Software 
While Olex2 comes with its own structure solution and refinement pro-grams (Olex2.solve and olex2.refine), ShelXS, ShelXM, ShelXL, SADABS (Bruker users only), XP (Bruker Users only) can also be used from within the Olex2 GUI. For academic users ShelXS and ShelXL, written by George Sheldrick, are freely available from http://shelx.uni-ac.gwdg.de/SHELX/ . If these already exist on your computer Olex2 will normally be able to locate them automatically. If this does not occur, it is necessary to specify the path to these files on your computer and add their location to the PATH line under the environment variables on your computer. Olex2 is currently also aware of XP (Bruker), Sadabs, Sir and Platon.
