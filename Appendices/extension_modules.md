# Extension Modules
We are currently working on a number of extension modules for Olex2, which will be available for testing in due course.
- _ReportPlus_: This module allows the generation of highly customisable, quality structure reports, either for a single structure or for multiple structures. This is very useful when it comes to combining structural data from multiple structures to create a set of structures ready for publication.
- _OrtepPlus_: While just about any ORTEP 'look' can be achieved with Olex2, getting the settings right can be quite a cumbersome undertaking. This module provides an easy-to-use GUI and a variety of commonly used presets for the generation of ORTEP-style pictures.
