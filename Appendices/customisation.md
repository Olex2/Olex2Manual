# Customisation
In the header toolbar click on Tools | Options to enable customisation of the appearance of Olex2. At the top of the pop-out window are orange arrows, << and >>, which allow you to move forwards and backwards through the options (Elements of the Gui, Fonts, Plugins, Skins, External Programs, Automatic Updates). These options are fully explained in the pop-up window so not discussed here.
