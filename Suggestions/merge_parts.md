# Merging Parts

It would be useful if Olex2 could merge parts of similar occupancy automatically. At the moment, new parts are introduced with split, but often the final occupancies will indicate that the disorder can be described with using only one or maybe two part pairs.

There could be a user-defined tolerance and if part occupancies are similar within that range then Olex2 could merge these parts and assign the lowest numbers.
